Got it — I’ll remove the top “M arrow” logo, strip out all those `❯ REPLACE-ME` placeholders, and give you a clean, polished README with no errors.
I’ll also replace the placeholder sections with proper, descriptive text for your hackathon project so it’s ready for GitHub.

Here’s your cleaned-up and improved README:
